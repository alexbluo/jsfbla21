# Maryland Tourist Attractions Searcher

## Overview

Website that suggests tourist attractions in Maryland based on user-defined attributes. Choose from over 300 filters via a familiar faceted or fulltext search and view detailed information on results narrowed down from 1000+ attractions. Interact with Google Maps to search for attractions within a chosen distance of you or another attraction.

## Tech Stack

This project uses the MERN stack, which is MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and a REST API. Other notable technologies used include:

- TailwindCSS (CSS framework)
- Redux Toolkit + React Redux (global state)
- React Query (fetching and caching)
- Vite (build tool)
- Docker (containerization)
- Heroku | GCP Cloud Run (deployment)
- Puppeteer (web scraping)

## Future Plans

Below is a list of features and technologies which are on track to be implemented, in order of precedence:

- Fulltext search
- Easy clearing of checked filters
- Embedded contact form
- List nearby places on map marker select
- Fancy nav bar stuff
- Dockerize and deploy to AWS/GCP because it sounds fun (serverless/PaaS)
- Machine learning using user behavior when entering typos like Google search "did you mean"
  - not enough data to get this done - not worth the time either, but fun idea
