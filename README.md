# Maryland Tourist Attractions Searcher
Created by Alex Luo for FBLA Coding & Programming 2021-2022

### Overview

### Tech Stack

This project uses the MERN stack, which is MongoDB, Express, React, Node, and a REST API. I also used some additional tools such as create-react-app, which utilizes webpack and websockets.

### Future Plans

Below is a list of features and technologies which are on track to be implemented, in order of precedence:

- Tailwind CSS
- Fulltext search
- Easy clearing of checked fields
- Redesign of map page UI and popup system
  - Replace current library for Google Maps API with one that supports both React and InfoWindows
  - Display information of the side instead of in popups
- Add maps to attraction detail pages
- Update to internal checkbox system
- Docker because it sounds fun
- Deploy with Heroku at the end
- Redo internal page system
- Style landing page
- Responsive layouts
- Performance improvements
